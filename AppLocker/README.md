# Microsoft AppLocker

Microsoft AppLocker is an [application whitelisting](https://www.iad.gov/iad/library/ia-guidance/security-tips/application-whitelisting.cfm) feature built into Windows. The use of application whitelisting is one of [IAD's top 10 mitigation strategies](https://www.iad.gov/iad/library/ia-guidance/iads-top-10-information-assurance-mitigation-strategies.cfm).

Group Policy Objects containing a base whitelisting policy for both [Audit mode](./Group Policy Objects/Computer/Audit) and [Enforcement mode](./Group Policy Objects/Computer/Enforced) policy are included in the SHB for Windows 10.
