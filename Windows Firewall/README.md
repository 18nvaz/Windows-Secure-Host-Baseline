# Windows Firewall
A [Group Policy Object](./Group Policy Objects/Computer/) for the Windows 10 firewall is included in the SHB. The GPO contains a basic configuration to enable the built in firewall and logging capabilities. 

## Compliance
The [Compliance](./Compliance/) folder contains a Nessus (aka [ACAS](http://www.disa.mil/cybersecurity/network-defense/acas) in the DoD) .audit file to check compliance with the settings implemented in the Group Policy Object.
